# cum - A Universal Machine in C language

The content of this repository is inspired by a topic from the 2006 ACM International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP).
[Here is the original version of the topic](http://www.boundvariable.org/task.shtml).

This work is part of my training period.\
I chose C language which allows me to use my [Data structure Vector](https://github.com/epatrizio/cds) implementation.
A good pedagogical approach ;)

## Current Status

For now, the Universal Machine is in alpha version.
