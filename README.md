# cum - A Universal Machine in C language

The content of this repository is inspired by a topic from the 2006 ACM International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP).
[Here is the original version of the topic](http://www.boundvariable.org/task.shtml).

This work is part of my training period. A very good educational low-level programming exercise ;)\
I chose C language which allows me to use my [Data structure Vector](https://github.com/epatrizio/cds) implementation.\
Vectors are used in a real and advanced context, which allowed me to discover and fix bugs!
[View issue](https://github.com/epatrizio/cds/issues/16).

## Current Status

This current version (first full version) works.\
Basic tests provided with the subject (sandmark.umz file) pass.

### Next steps

* codex.umz file execution pass to!
* bootstrapping pass to! It's fun because the um.um file is a more advanced UM implementation which execute itself in our implementation!

See documentation above (topic link) for the decryption key (codex.umz) and the bootstrapping initialization.
